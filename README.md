<h1 align="center">Face Mask Detection</h1>


<div align= "center">
  <h4>Face Mask Detection system built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in real-time video streams and send an email if a visitor is found not wearing a mask</h4>
</div>

<div>
<h3> Additional Features </h3>
<h5>
The model is made in such a way that it is directly integrateable with any facility. Using the smtplib and tkinter library in python,the stream automatically shows a pop-up in case a visitor is detected with no mask in addition to a mail sent to the facility's IT department with details regarding the person.
This can be further optimized with automating the code in such a way that a snapshot is clicked every time a person is detected not wearing a mask which can,then,be sent to the facility too.

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, 
densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety.A bigger problem rests on the hands of the population who willingly choose to either wear masks or not. 
This was made from the perspective of any organization choosing to automate their process of tracking visitors who aren't wearing masks.


<h3>Further Details <h3>
<p> Epochs ran during development : 100 
Accuracy obtained : 99.94%
Ideally,during production, the epochs should be close to 1000 to train the model better.<p>
